             NOTE: WORK IN PROGRESS - for now this will just clean out all triangles from
             inside the outermost holes without paying attention to holes within holes..
             hence the work in progress :)
             
             Removes triangles inside "holes" (that are not inside of other holes already)
             
             In the example below, assume that triangle ABC is a user-defined "hole".  Thus
             any triangles inside it (that aren't inside yet another user-defined hole inside
             triangle ABC) should get removed.  In this case, since there are no user-defined
             holes inside ABC, we would remove triangles ADE, BCE, and CDE.  We would also 
             need to combine the appropriate edges so that we end up with just triangle ABC

            This method detects if two line segments (or lines) intersect,

            <paramref name="secondIsSegment"/> parameters to set whether the intersection point
            must be on the first and second line segments. Setting these

            intersection. Setting one of them to true means you are doing a
            line to line-segment intersection test, and so on.
            Note: If two line segments are coincident, then 
            no intersection is detected (there are actually

             If the polygons intersect, then poly1 cannot contain poly2 (or vice-versa for that matter)
             Since the poly intersection test can be somewhat expensive, we'll only run it if the user
             requests it.   If runIntersectionTest is false, then it is assumed that the user has already
             verified that the polygons do not intersect.  If the polygons DO intersect and runIntersectionTest
             is false, then the return value is meaningless.  Caveat emptor.
             
             As an added bonus, just to cause more user-carnage, if runIntersectionTest is false, then the 
             boundRects are not used and can safely be passed in as nulls.   However, if runIntersectionTest
             is true and you pass nulls for boundRect1 or boundRect2, you will cause a program crash.
             
             Finally, the polygon points are assumed to be passed in Clockwise winding order.   It is possible
             that CounterClockwise ordering would work, but I have not verified the behavior in that case.
